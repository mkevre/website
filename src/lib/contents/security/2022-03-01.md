We deployed a [security update](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/8334) to Gitpod. This prevents an unsecured Google API endpoint from being available which can lead to information disclosure between workspaces.

If you are running a self-hosted installation of Gitpod, this is unlikely to affect you - we recommend updating to [version 2022.01](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases/tag/2022.01) nevertheless.

### Background

We have been notified about this issue on February 20th which has been reviewed, validated and remediated the same day. Furthermore we conducted a root-cause analysis to identify and remediate the underlying issues of this exploit.

### Lessons we learned

- We are now running active checks that will terminate the session when a workspace is connecting to the metadata api [#8334](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/8334)
- The issue will be subject to penetration testing procedures
- We are adding automated tests which ensure the aforementioned checks remain in effect

### Kudos to Alan and the Team

We would like to thank [Alan Cao](https://twitter.com/AlanCao5) for notifying us about this issue including a comprehensive write-up that allowed an easy revalidation. Also, the Gitpod teams understood and remediated the issue swiftly - the timely response is key.
